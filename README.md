## Cake

![Alt text](img/cake.jpg?raw=true "Title")

Use a Cakefile to define a list of targets, the targets they depend on and
steps (in the form of shell commands) to accomplish each one.

Cake builds and sorts a DAG before processing your targets in topological
order!

### Build
```
make cake
```

### Test
```
./cake.out
```
